		<p> This project was completed as part of the Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp curriculum. Each drop down menu in the web app is connected to the database, and will autopopulate
		all options available to the user, even if the database is updated. The program integrates the use of Java, SQL, Spring MVC, and JSTL. 
		Both the front and back-end were designed by Kaylee.  </p>

		<p> Overall, I would give myself a B+ on this project. While I worked extremely hard, and was able to finish most of the intensive back-end coding by 
		Friday morning because I stayed late throughout the week and got help from instructors and TAs early, I did not utilize prepared statements in my code. By the time 
		went over them in class most of my back-end code was completed, and I was extremely nervous about breaking everything if I tried to convert to prepared statements.  
		Still, I understand they are an important concept to master, and I will put time in this week to become better at writing them. 
		  </p>
		  <p>I did do my best to handle fringe cases in my application, doing all in my power to make sure my code doesn't "blow up" but instead
		  lets the user know what went wrong. If an incorrect Employee ID is put into my program the application should let the user know. I incorporated JSTL code to handle different
		  cases that my user might encounter depending upon what they input. I also spent quite a few hours working on the CSS of my project, using my
		  free time and lunch breaks to learn "flexbox" so that I could create a more responsive front-end than
		  what I've designed in the past.  </p>
